# `VPixx` system on the 7T

This page provides information and some visual stimulus code for the 7T, notes for running frm the  `VPixx` system on the dedicated machine with `octave`+`Psychtoolbox` under the `ubuntu` install.

## General points

- we have a `PROPixx` display system with audio, button boxes, analogue and digital I/O
- the projector lives in the scanner room in a shielded box
- the preferred way of driving the system is under Linux\`ubuntu` through `gnu/octave` (other possibilities exist but are not a top-priority for now)


## Sample code for testing

- `SPMIC_demo_01` - grabs display, puts a yellow dot on the screen and moves it. For checking whether `VPixx` display gets picked up etc
- `SPMIC_demo_02` - simple implementation of a block design (static and moving faces, static objects, gray background). Timing can be adjusted pretty easily - has some opinionated suggestions on how to organise code.
- `ProceduralNoiseForObjects` - how to make dynamic noise using GPU (rather than pre-computed images and blitting them). Still needs some debugging re ALPHA blending to make it work with background suppression in movie / masked image stimuli
- `movie_test_{01,02}` - initial movie testing to check that movies can be loaded ok and display on screen. working.

## To-dos (some physical)

- [ ] add a second display for coding (current console room display mirrors projector)
- [ ] test 45ยบ mirror for projecting along line of bore + screen material
- [ ] document minimal test code + examples
- [ ] document (SOP) for switching on/off projector, how to bring your own code, etc.
- [ ] provide guidance to those wanting to write code away from console room (eg [coding / debugging on MacOS/Apple hardware](./macos-notes.md) requires some additional hoop-jumping)
 
## Initial vision experiment for `UHFVIS` project

Some notes and a [scanning-readme](./vision-experiment.md) for getting off the ground.

## Documentation from `VPixx` website 

Trying out a couple of provided demos to test digital IO and also ProPIXX display capabilities:
