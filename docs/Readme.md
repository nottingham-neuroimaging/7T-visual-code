## General points

- we have a `PROPixx` display system with audio, button boxes, analogue and digital I/O
- the projector lives in the scanner room in a shielded box
- the preferred way of driving the system is under Linux\`ubuntu` through `gnu/octave` (other possibilities exist but are not a top-priority for now)


## To-do's

- [ ] add a second display for coding (current console room display mirrors projector)
- [ ] test 45ยบ mirror for projecting along line of bore + screen material
- [ ] document minimal test code + examples
- [ ] document (SOP) for switching on/off projector, how to bring your own code, etc.
- [ ] provide guidance to those wanting to write code away from console room (eg [coding / debugging on MacOS/Apple hardware](./macos-notes.md) requires some additional hoop-jumping)
 


## Documentation from `VPixx` website 

Trying out a couple of provided demos to test digital IO and also ProPIXX display capabilities:
